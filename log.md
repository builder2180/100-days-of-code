# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 6th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 54% of the basic javascript completed. Embarked on a random number/odd-even activity to apply some of these skills learnt. 

**Thoughts:** The application made it more interesting and I definitely learnt more this way than simply folllowing freeCodeCamp.
